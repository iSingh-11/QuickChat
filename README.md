# QuickChat
As the name suggests, QuickChat is an online texting platform where a user can login and can chat with family and friends individually or in groups. The idea is being taken from WhatsApp Web. Group chats has admin controls features for group admins. A user can add or remove contacts, can create new groups, can join existing groups through an invitation link, can clear chat history and can edit his/her name, status and DP as per choice. A chat thread supports sending texts, images, videos, pdfs and invitation links of groups, each with a small preview before sending with custom captions which is optional. The project involved working on Front End Technologies like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery, and Bootstrap and currently has no Database Connectivity but a sample database is available within the webpage in hidden html tags which was used while testing each functionality.
